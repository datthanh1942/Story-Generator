# Story-Generator
Utilize the GPT-3.5 API to generate stories based on user-selected features. Next, employ the Stable Diffusion API to create images from detailed prompts processed via the superprompt API. Finally, present all of this content within Gradio Apps. Additionally, itâ€™s possible to explore story excerpts using the output link

### The code is designed and executed on Google Colab, so I will outline two methods to run the code:
#### Running on Google Colab
- Run all the cells to display the application.
- You can access the provided link to open the application on the website.
- Enter the corresponding keywords to generate stories as desired.

#### Running outside Google Colab
- Install the necessary libraries:
``` pip install openai==0.28 gradio diffusers invisible_watermark transformers accelerate safetensors ```
- Run the code in the second cell to open the application, similar to running it on Google Colab.

**Note: The environment needs to have CUDA to run on GPU, which supports the tasks in the model.
